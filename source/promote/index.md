## Purpose

Over the last decade or so, I've been using Github, StackOverflow, GitLab, ... for work.
I've been using open source projects and making feedbacks via issues or pull request.

The fate of those contributions is not always the same.
Sometimes, they are taken into account quickly and solve/integrated/...
Sometimes, they are ignored or not taken into account. This is pretty normal for any project, especially open source projects

In some cases, there already is an open issue or Pull Request in progress that I'd like to move forward.

In order to improve the odds of those contributions to be taken into account, I usually share those with colleagues and peers to "up vote/thumbs up" them.

## The List

Here is my current list as of Aug 2023:

* 𝋁 Improvement on SignalR: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/48624
* 𝋂 Improvement in SignalR Docs: https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/29435
  * But I think this one is being solved by this MR: https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/2479 (will probably land in .Net 7 or 8)
* 𝋃 Excel-DNA on dotnet > 6 https://github.com/Excel-DNA/ExcelDna/issues/538
* 𝋄 Better understanding the source of a Security Advisory: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90170#issuecomment-1676341808
* 𝋅 Publish newer official Docker images for RedisInsight: https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight/issues/519

So, don't hesitate to add a thumbs up for those issue!

Thank you
