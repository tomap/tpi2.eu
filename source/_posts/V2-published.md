V2 of this site has been published.

I also pushed it on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomap/tpi2.eu).

Also, OVH supports free https certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Nothing complicated, just using the admin console. [See their blog](https://www.ovh.co.uk/news/articles/a2224.ovh-your-free-ssl-certificates-via-lets-encrypt).

Now I'll configure automatic deployment with [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) and restore lost images :)
