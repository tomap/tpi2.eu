Thanks to DocPad, I'm learning new languages:

- CoffeeScript is not so easy to learn, but a lot cleaner than plain JS.
- Markdown is also very simple. Makes you focus on text, not on format. Like wiki syntax.
- [CoffeeKup](http://coffeekup.org/) is interesting but very confusing when you practiced HTML for a long time.

Originally, this site skeleton was a clone of [Benjamin Lupton's website](http://BaLupton.com), but I made some changes.
Everything has been pushed to GitHub.

I also restored Disqus comments.

I am working on integrating a FTP module to Docpad in order to automatically upload new changes to tp√Æ.eu, without having to use a FTP Client.
