<P>
After my last post, I wanted to write something about IDN and browser support.<br>
So I made lot's of screen shots about how well IDN is supported.<br>
Then I figured that if I ever wanted to do more than one post with images on this blog, I had to host those images somewhere...<br>
So, I started looking at some image hosting services, like google, 500px, ... and in the end, I choose flickr because they have an API, and I already had an account.<br>
In order to avoid uploading images one by one and linking them to my post, I have tried to automate this process using a docpad plugin:
</P>
<h2>
	docpad-plugin-flickrimages
</h2>
<P>
	This plugin is a fork from <a href='https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-associatedfiles/'>docpad-flickr-associatedfiles</a>.
	It's a start :).<br>
	Here is how it works:
	<ol>
		<li>List all images in a dedicated folder</li>
		<li>Call Flickr to get the list of images with a tag ("docpad" by default, but can be configured)</li>
		<li>Get additional properties (url of images in various sizes,...)</li>
		<li>If local image is not on flickr, upload it</li>
		<li>If local image is on flickr, check the last update, and update the image if necessary</li>
		<li>Remove local image from filethat needs to be copied to the output directory</li>
		<li>In any page, add a link to an image using document.getFlickrImage('my image.png')</li>
		<li> this call will be replace by a reference to the image on flickr</li>
	</ol>
	Currently some thing are not yet working:
	<ul>
		<li>Update an image</li>
		<li>There are no tests</li>
		<li>Error cases are not working</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	A little example:
</p>
[EDIT: Fev 2017: does not work yet in Hugo]<br>
%- @getDocument().getFlickrImage('blog post code.png') %<br>
%- @getDocument().getFlickrImage('beaglebone.jpg') %<br>
<P>
	Also: by default, getFlickrImage return a piece of HTML that works fine with fancybox.
