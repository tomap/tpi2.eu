This post is about IDN (International Domain Names) and browser support in 2019, 5 years after the previous one. And hopefully, I'll publish this one faster than the previous one.

## Android

 In 2019, Android has a lot of browser, but I only looked at a few of them:

### Chrome

Perfect

### Firefox

Perfect

### Edge

Perfect

### DuckDuckGo

Not properly displayed (Yes, they have a browser)

It's even worse, if you type only 'tp√Æ.eu', you get redirected to the search engine, not the famous site. You need to type the full https://
But I get it, for a privacy oriented browser, it's probably more important to prevent phishing than to play nice with IDN

## iOS

Tests were done on an iPad.

### Safari

It's working on Android but not on iOS... Why?

### Edge
