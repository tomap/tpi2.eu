I'm making some progress.

Some context:

- I am hosted by OVH with a .eu domain (they have an offer for [0.99 euros](http://www.ovh.com/fr/domaines/doteu.xml) until January 31)
- I choose a 3 letters domain : _tp√Æ.eu_ (IDN provide plenty of new ** short domain ** names!)
- I am using DocPad to run this site, so no PHP, no SQL, no CGI, ... which makes a lot of sense since I wouldn't need a incredible database to store a few 'static' blog posts
- After feeling so smart about this 3 letters domain, I found out that IDN are a lot messier than they look (I'll do a separate post about that)

To be continued :)
